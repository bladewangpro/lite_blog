Two Sum, Number of Islands, Reorder Data in Log Files, Add Two numbers, LRU Cache


**Time and Space Complexity**
[Time Complexity and Three different notations](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/complexity-analysis/time-and-space-complexity/tutorial/#:~:text=Time%20complexity%20of%20an%20algorithm,the%20length%20of%20the%20input.)

1. Time and space complexity depends on factors like hardware, operation system and processors.
2. They are considering the worst case scenario

> O-notation (to denote asymptotic upper bound) --> actual needed time is little bigger than the time denoted by O-notation
> \omega-notation (to denote asymptotic lower bound) --> actual needed time is little smaller than the time denoted by O-notation
> \theta-notation (to denote tight bound)



**order of growth**
how the time of excution depends on the length of the input.
<u>But the term are relatively insignificant for large input.</u>


**Class**

```python3
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, num: List[int], target: int):
        pass
```

## Number of Islands

> Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```Python3
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
------------------------
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```



### Grammar

1. extend and append

append: Adds its arguments as a single elements to the end of list. The length of the list increase by one.
extend: Iterates over its argument and adding each element to the list and extending the list. The length of the list increases by number of elements in its argument.

2. set

an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.

### Algorithm

#### Depth-first search

1. Pick any node. If it is unvisited, mark it as visited and recur on all its adjacent nodes.
2. Repeat until all the nodes are visted, or the node to be search is found

#### Breadth-first search

1. Pick any node, visit the adjacent unvisited vertex, mark it as visited, display it, and insert it in a queue.
2. if there are no remaining adjacent vertices left, remove  the first vertex from the queue.
3. repeat step 1 and step 2 until the queue is empty or the desired node is found.

```Python3
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

visited = []
queue = []

def bfs(visited, graph, node):
    visited.append(node)
    queue.append(node)
    while queue:
        s = queue.pop(0)
        print(s, end=" ")
        for neighbor in graph[s]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

bfs(visited, graph, 'A')
```




### Solution

```Python3
"""DFS solution
"""

def numIslands(self, grid):
    """
    :type grid: List[List[str]]
    :rtype: int
    """
    if not grid:
        return 0
    num = 0
    visited = set()

    rlen = len(grid)
    clen = len(grid[0])

    for x in range(rlen):
        for y in range(clen):
            if grid[x][y] == '1' and (x, y) not in visited:
                num += 1
                self.dfs(grid, x, y, visited, rlen, clen)
    return num
                    
    
def dfs(self, grid, x, y, visited, rlen, clen):
    if x > -1 and x < rlen and y > -1 and y < clen\
    and (x, y) not in visited and grid[x][y] == '1':
        visited.add((x, y))
        self.dfs(grid, x - 1, y, visited, rlen, clen)
        self.dfs(grid, x + 1, y, visited, rlen, clen)
        self.dfs(grid, x, y - 1, visited, rlen, clen)
        self.dfs(grid, x, y + 1, visited, rlen, clen)
```

## Two Sum

> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

```Python3
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

### Solution

1. Objective, For each element in this list, to find the corresponding location information of an another number which add it up to target -> make a correlation dictionary and value means the location. 

2. how to find the another number -> target - element == another number or element = target - element


```Python3
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    loc_dic = dict()
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        loc_dic[target-nums[i]] = i

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] in loc_dic:
            if i != loc_dic[nums[i]]:
                return [i, loc_dic[nums[i]]]
```

## Reorder Data in Log File

> You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words. For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either: Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or; Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits. We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier. Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order. Return the final order of the logs.

```Python3
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

Constraints:

0 <= logs.length <= 100
3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.
```

### Grammar

#### Sorted of list

sorted(list, key=lambda x: x[0])

### Solution

```Python3
def reorderLogFiles(self, logs):
    """
    :type logs: List[str]
    :rtype: List[str]
    """
    let = [e for e in logs if e.split()[1:][0].isalpha()]
    dig = [e for e in logs if e.split()[1:][0].isdigit()]
    return sorted(let, key = lambda x: [x.split()[1:], x.split()[0]]) + dig
```

## Add Two Numbers
> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

```Python3
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```
Traverse on linked list


### Solution

```Python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        temp0 = l1.next
        temp1 = l2.next
        result = ListNode(l1.val + l2.val)
        temp = result
        carry = 0
        if result.val > 9:
            result.val -= 10
            carry = 1
        while temp0 or temp1 or carry:
            temp.next = ListNode(0)
            temp = temp.next
            temp.val += carry
            carry = 0
            if temp0:
                temp.val += temp0.val
                temp0 = temp0.next
            if temp1:
                temp.val += temp1.val
                temp1 = temp1.next
            if temp.val > 9:
                temp.val -= 10
                carry = 1
        return result
```

## LRU Cache

> Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put. get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item. The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

```Python3
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
```

### Grammar

#### collections.OrderedDict

Pythonâ€™s collections module has another great subclass of dict known as OrderedDict. As the name implies, this dictionary keeps track of the order of the keys as they are added. If you create a regular dict, you will note that it is an unordered data collection

```Python3
dic = collections.OrderedDict()
dic.pop(...)
dic.popitem(last=False) # Pop the first key-value pair
```

### Solution

```Python3
class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        import collections
        self.dic = collections.OrderedDict()
        self.capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.dic:
            buffer = self.dic[key]
            self.dic.pop(key)
            self.dic[key] = buffer
            return buffer
        else:
            return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        self.dic.pop(key, None)
        self.dic[key] = value
        if len(self.dic) > self.capacity:
            self.dic.popitem(last=False)
            


# Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = LRUCache(capacity)
# param_1 = obj.get(key)
# obj.put(key,value)
```
